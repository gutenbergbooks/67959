<h2 class="nobreak" id="INDIAN_HEMP_c">INDIAN HEMP, &amp;c.</h2>
</div>
<hr class="r5" />

<p>The narcotic effects of hemp are popularly known in the South of
Africa, South America, Turkey, Egypt, Asia Minor, India, and the
adjacent territories of the Malays, Burmese, and Siamese. In all
these countries hemp is used in various forms, by the dissipated
and depraved, as the ready agent of a pleasing intoxication. In the
popular medicine of these nations, we find it extensively employed
for a multitude of affections, especially those in which spasm or
neuralgic pain are the prominent symptoms. But in Western Europe its
use, either as a stimulant or as a remedy, is equally unknown. With the
exception of the trial, as a frolic, of the Egyptian “hasheesh,” by a
few youths in Marseilles, and of the clinical use of the wine of hemp
by Hahnemann, as shown in a subsequent extract, I have been unable to
trace any notice of the employment of this drug in Europe.</p>

<p>Much difference of opinion exists on the question, whether the hemp
so abundant in Europe, even in high northern latitudes, is identical
in specific characters with the hemp of Asia Minor and India. The
extraordinary symptoms produced by the latter depend on a resinous
secretion with which it abounds, and which seems totally absent in
the European kind. The closest physical resemblance or even identity
exists between both plants; difference of climate seems to me more
than sufficient to account for the absence of the resinous secretion,
and consequent want of narcotic power in that indigenous in colder
countries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span></p>

<p>In the subsequent article I first endeavour to present an adequate
view of what has been recorded of the early history, the popular uses,
and employment in medicine of this powerful and valuable substance; I
then proceed to notice several experiments which I have instituted on
animals, with the view to ascertain its effects on the healthy system;
and, lastly, I submit an abstract of the clinical details of the
treatment of several patients afflicted with hydrophobia, tetanus, and
other convulsive disorders, in which a preparation of hemp was employed
with results, which seem to me to warrant our anticipating from its
more extensive and impartial use no inconsiderable addition to the
resources of the physician.</p>

<p>In the historical and statistical department of the subject, I owe
my cordial thanks for most valuable assistance to the distinguished
traveller the Syed Keramut Ali, Mootawulee of the Hooghly Imambarrah,
and also to the Hakim Mirza Abdul Razes of Teheran, who have furnished
me with interesting details regarding the consumption of hemp in
Candahar, Cabul, and the countries between the Indus and Herat. The
Pandit Moodoosudun Gootu has favored me with notices of the statements
regarding hemp in the early Sanscrit authors on materia medica; to
the celebrated Kamalakantha Vidyalanka, the Pandit of the Asiatic
Society, I have also to record my acknowledgments; <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> DaCosta has
obligingly supplied me with copious notes from the “Mukzun-ul-Udwieh,”
and other Persian and Hindee systems of materia medica. For information
relative to the varieties of the drug, and its consumption in Bengal,
<abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> McCann, the deputy superintendent of police, deserves my thanks;
and, lastly, to the medical gentlemen named in the sequel, I feel much
indebted for the clinical details with which they have enriched the
subject.</p>


<h3><i>Botanical Characters—Chemical Properties—Production.</i></h3>

<p><i>Botanical Description.</i>—Assuming, with Lindley and other
eminent writers, that the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cannabis sativa</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Indica</i> are
identical, we find that the plant is diœcious, annual, about three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
feet high, covered over with a fine pubescence; the stem is erect,
branched, bright green, angular; leaves, alternate or opposite, on long
weak petioles; digitate, scabrous, with linear, lanceolate, sharply
serrated leaflets, tapering into a long smooth entire point; stipules
subulate; clusters of flowers axillary with subulate bractes; males lax
and drooping, branched and leafless at base; females erect, simple and
leafy at the base. Calyx downy, five parted, imbricated. Stamens five;
anthers large and pendulous. Calyx covered with brown glands. Ovary
roundish with pendulous ovule, and two long filiform glandular stigmas;
achenium ovate, one seeded.—<i>Vide Lindley’s Flora Medica</i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 299.</p>

<p>The fibres of the stems are long and extremely tenacious, so as to
afford the best tissue for cordage, thus constituting the material for
one of the most important branches of European manufactures.</p>

<p>The seed is simply albuminous and oily, and is devoid of all narcotic
properties.</p>

<p><i>Chemical Properties.</i>—In certain seasons and in warm countries
a resinous juice exudes and concretes on the leaves, slender stems,
and flowers; the mode of removing this juice will be subsequently
detailed. Separated and in masses it constitutes the <i>churrus</i><a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
of Nipal and Hindostan, and to this, the type or basis of all the hemp
preparations, are the powers of these drugs attributable.</p>

<p>The resin of the hemp is soluble in alcohol and æther; partially
soluble in alkaline, insoluble in acid solutions; when pure, of a
blackish grey color; hard at 90°; softens at higher temperatures, and
fuses readily; soluble in the fixed and in several volatile oils. Its
odor is fragrant and narcotic; taste slightly warm, bitterish, and
acrid.</p>

<p>The dried hemp plant, which has flowered and <em>from which the resin
has not been removed</em>, is called <span class="allsmcap">GUNJAH</span>. It sells for
1s. 6d. to 2s. for 2 <abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr> in the Calcutta bazaars, and yields to
alcohol<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span> twenty per 100 of resinous extract, composed of the resin
(<i>churrus</i>), and green coloring matter (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">chlorophylle</i>).
Distilled with a large quantity of water or spirit, traces of essential
oil pass over, and the distilled liquor has the powerful narcotic
odor of the plant. The <i>gunjah</i> is sold for smoking chiefly. The
bundles of <i>gunjah</i> are about two feet long and four inches in
diameter, and contain twenty-four plants. The color is dusky green; the
odor agreeably narcotic; the whole plant resinous and adhesive to the
touch.</p>

<p>The larger leaves and capsules, without the stalks, are called
“<i>bang</i>, <i>subjee</i>, or <i>sidhee</i>.” They are used for
making an intoxicating drink, for smoking, and in the conserve
or confection termed <i>majoon</i>. <i>Bang</i> is cheaper than
<i>gunjah</i>, and, though less powerful, is sold at such a low price
that for less than a half-penny enough can be purchased to intoxicate
an “experienced” person.</p>

<p>According to <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> McCann’s notes, the <i>gunjah</i> consumed in Bengal
is chiefly brought from Mirzapore and Ghazeepore, being extensively
cultivated near Gwalior and in Tirhoot. The natives cut the plant when
in flower, allow it to dry for three days, and then lay it in bundles
averaging two pounds weight each, which are distributed to the licensed
dealers. The best kinds are brought from Gwalior and Bhurtpore, and it
is also cultivated, of good quality, in a few gardens round Calcutta.
In Jessore, I am informed, the drug is produced of excellent quality
and to a very considerable extent of cultivation. In Central India, and
the Saugor territory, and in Nipal, <i>churrus</i> is collected during
the hot season in the following singular manner:—Men clad in leathern
dresses run through the hemp fields, brushing through the plant with
all possible violence; the soft resin adheres to the leather, and is
subsequently scraped off and kneaded into balls, which sell from 10s.
to 12s. for 2 <abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr> A still finer kind, the <i>momeea</i> or waxen
<i>churrus</i>, is collected by the hand in Nipal and sells for nearly
double the price of the ordinary kind. In Nipal, <abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr> McKinnon informs
me, the leathern attire is dispensed with, and the resin is gathered
on the skins of naked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span> coolies. In Persia, it is stated by Mirza Abdul
Razes that the <i>churrus</i> is prepared by pressing the resinous
plant on coarse cloths, and then scraping it from these and melting it
in a pot with a little warm water. He considers the <i>churrus</i> of
Herat as the best and most powerful of all the varieties of the drug.</p>


<h3><i>Popular Uses.</i></h3>

<p>The preparations of hemp are used for the purpose of intoxication as
follows:—</p>

<p><i>Sidhee</i>, <i>subjee</i>, and <i>bang</i> (synonymous) are used
with water as a drink, which is thus prepared. About three tola weight,
540 troy grains, are well washed with cold water, then dried and rubbed
to powder, mixed with black pepper, cucumber and melon seeds, sugar,
half a pint of milk, and an equal quantity of water. This is considered
sufficient to intoxicate an habituated person. Half the quantity is
enough for a novice. This composition is chiefly used by the Mahomedans
of the better class.</p>

<p>Another recipe is as follows:—</p>

<p>The same quantity of <i>sidhee</i> is washed, dried, and ground, mixed
with black pepper, and a quart of cold water added. This is drank at
one sitting. This is the favorite beverage of the Hindus who practice
this vice, especially the Birjobassies and many of the Rajpootana
soldiery.</p>

<p>From either of these beverages intoxication will ensue in half an hour.
Almost invariably the inebriation is of the most cheerful kind, causing
the person to sing and dance, to eat food with great relish, and to
seek aphrodisiac enjoyments. In persons of a quarrelsome disposition
it occasions, as might be expected, an exasperation of their natural
tendency. The intoxication lasts about three hours, when sleep
supervenes. No nausea or sickness of the stomach succeeds, nor are the
bowels at all affected; next day there is slight giddiness and much
vascularity of the eyes, but no other symptom worth recording.</p>

<p><i>Gunjah</i> is used for smoking only: one rupee weight, 180 grains,
and a little dried tobacco are rubbed together in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span> palm of the hand
with a few drops of water. This suffices for three persons. A little
tobacco is placed in the pipe first, then a layer of the prepared
<i>gunjah</i>, then more tobacco, and the fire above all.</p>

<p>Four or five persons usually join in this debauch. The hookah is
passed round, and each person takes a single draught. Intoxication
ensues almost instantly; and from one draught to the unaccustomed,
within half an hour; and after four or five inspirations to those more
practised in the vice. The effects differ from those occasioned by the
<i>sidhee</i>. Heaviness, laziness, and agreeable reveries ensue, but
the person can be readily roused, and is able to discharge routine
occupations, such as pulling the punkah, waiting at table, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The <i>majoon</i>, or hemp confection, is a compound of sugar, butter,
flour, milk, and <i>sidhee</i> or <i>bang</i>. The process has been
repeatedly performed before me by Ameer, the proprietor of a celebrated
place of resort for hemp devotees in Calcutta, and who is considered
the best artist in his profession. Four ounces of <i>sidhee</i> and
an equal quantity of <i>ghee</i> (clarified butter) are placed in an
earthen or well-tinned vessel, a pint of water added, and the whole
warmed over a charcoal fire. The mixture is constantly stirred until
the water all boils away, which is known by the crackling noise of the
melted butter on the sides of the vessel; the mixture is then removed
from the fire, squeezed through cloth while hot—by which an oleaginous
solution of the active principles and coloring matter of the hemp is
obtained—and the leaves, fibres, &amp;c., remaining on the cloth are
thrown away.</p>

<p>The green oily solution soon concretes into a buttery mass, and is
then well washed by the hand with soft water so long as the water
becomes colored. The coloring matter and an extractive substance are
thus removed, and a very pale green mass, of the consistence of simple
ointment, remains. The washings are thrown away; Ameer says that these
are intoxicating, and produce constriction of the throat, great pain,
and very disagreeable and dangerous symptoms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>

<p>The operator then takes two pounds of sugar, and, adding a little
water, places it in a pipkin over the fire. When the sugar dissolves
and froths, two ounces of milk are added; a thick scum rises and is
removed; more milk and a little water are added from time to time,
and the boiling continued about an hour, the solution being carefully
stirred until it becomes an adhesive clear syrup, ready to solidify
on a cold surface; four ounces of <i>tyre</i> (new milk dried before
the sun) in fine powder are now stirred in, and, lastly, the prepared
butter of hemp is introduced, brisk stirring being continued for a few
minutes. A few drops of uttur of roses are then quickly sprinkled in,
and the mixture poured from the pipkin on a flat cold dish or slab.
The mass concretes immediately into a thin cake, which is divided into
small lozenge-shaped pieces. Thus prepared it sells for 8s. the 2 lbs;
one drachm, by weight, will intoxicate a beginner; three drachms one
experienced in its use. The taste is sweet, and the odor very agreeable.</p>

<p>Ameer states that there are seven or eight <i>majoon</i> makers in
Calcutta; that sometimes, by special order of customers, he introduces
stramonium seeds, but never nux vomica; that all classes of persons,
including the lower Portuguese or “Kala Feringhees,” and especially
their females, consume the drug; that it is most fascinating in its
effects, producing extatic happiness, a persuasion of high rank, a
sensation of flying, voracious appetite, and intense aphrodisiac
desire. He denies that its continued use leads to madness, impotence,
or to the numerous evil consequences described by the Arabic and
Persian physicians. Although I disbelieve Ameer’s statements on this
point, his description of the immediate effects of <i>majoon</i> is
strictly and accurately correct.</p>

<p>Most carnivorous animals eat it greedily, and very soon experience its
narcotic effects, becoming ludicrously drunk, but seldom suffering any
worse consequences.</p>


<h3><i>Historical Details—Notices of Hemp and its Uses, by the Sanscrit,
Arabic, and Persian Writers.</i></h3>

<p>The preceding notice suffices to explain the subsequent historical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
and medicinal details. I premise the historical, in order to show the
exact state of our knowledge of the subject, when I attempted its
investigation.</p>

<p>Although the most eminent of the Arabic and Persian authors concur
in referring the origin of the practice of hemp intoxication to the
natives of Hindostan, it is remarkable that few traces can be detected
of the prevalence of the vice at any early period in India.</p>

<p>The Pandit Moodoosudun Gooptu finds that the “Rajniguntu,” a
standard treatise on materia medica, which he estimates vaguely at
600 years date, gives a clear account of this agent. Its synonymes
are “<i>bijoya</i>,” “<i>ujoya</i>,” and “<i>joya</i>,” names which
mean promoters of success; “<i>brijputta</i>,” or the strengthener,
or the strong-leaved; “<i>chapola</i>,” the causer of a reeling
gait; “<i>ununda</i>,” or the laughter-moving; “<i>hursini</i>,”
the exciter of sexual desire. Its effects on man are described as
excitant, heating, astringent. It is added that it “destroys phlegm,
expels flatulence, induces costiveness, sharpens the memory, increases
eloquence, excites the appetite, and acts as a general tonic.”</p>

<p>The “Rajbulubha,” a Sanscrit treatise of rather later date, alludes
to the use of hemp in gonorrhœa, and repeats the statements of the
“Rajniguntu.” In the Hindu Tantra, a religious treatise, teaching
peculiar and mystical formulæ and rites for the worship of the deities,
it is said, moreover, that <i>sidhee</i> is more intoxicating than wine.</p>

<p>In the celebrated “Susruta,” which is perhaps the most ancient of all
Hindu medical works, it is written, that persons laboring under catarrh
should, with other remedies, use internally the <i>bijoya</i> or
<i>sidhee</i>. The effects, however, are not described.</p>

<p>The learned Kamalakantha Vidyalanka has traced a notice of hemp in the
5th chapter of <i>Menu</i>, where Brahmins are prohibited to use the
following substances—<i>palandoo</i> or onions, <i>gunjara</i> or
<i>gunjah</i>, and such condiments as have strong and pungent scents.</p>

<p>The Arabic and Persian writers are, however, far more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span> voluminous and
precise in their accounts of these fascinating preparations. In the 1st
<abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> of De Sacy’s “Crestomathie Arabe” we find an extremely interesting
summary of the writings of Takim Eddin Makrizi on this subject. Lane
has noticed it too with his usual ability in his admirable work, “the
Modern Egyptians.” From these two sources, the MS. notes of the Syed
Keramut Ali and <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> DaCosta, and a curious paper communicated by our
friend Mirza Abdul Razes, a most intelligent Persian physician, the
following epitome is compiled:—</p>

<p>Makrizi treats of the hemp in his glowing description of the celebrated
Canton de la Timbaliere, the ancient pleasure grounds, in the vicinity
of Cairo. This quarter, after many vicissitudes, is now a heap of
ruins. In it was situated a cultivated valley named Djoneina, which
we are informed was the theatre of all conceivable abominations. It
was famous above all for the sale of the <i>hasheeha</i>, which is
still greedily consumed by the dregs of the populace, and from the
consumption of which sprung the excesses which led to the name of
“assassin” being given to the Saracens in the Holy Wars. The history of
the drug the author treats of thus:—The oldest work in which hemp is
noticed is a treatise by Hasan, who states that in the year 658, <span class="allsmcap">M.
E.</span> the Sheikh Djafar Shirazi, a monk of the order of Haider,
learned from his master the history of the discovery of hemp. Haider,
the chief of ascetics and self-chasteners, lived in rigid privation on
a mountain between Nishabor and Ramah, where he established a monastery
of Fakirs. Ten years he had spent in this retreat without leaving it
for a moment, till one burning summer’s day when he departed alone to
the fields. On his return an air of joy and gaiety was imprinted on
his countenance; he received the visits of his brethren and encouraged
their conversation. On being questioned, he stated that, struck by the
aspect of a plant which danced in the heat as if with joy, while all
the rest of the vegetable creation was torpid, he had gathered and
eaten of its leaves. He led his companions to the spot,—all ate and
all were similarly excited. A tincture of the hemp leaf in wine or
spirit seems to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span> been the favourite formula in which the Sheikh
Haider indulged himself. An Arab poet sings of Haider’s <em>emerald</em>
cup—an evident allusion to the rich green colour of the tincture of
the drug. The Sheikh survived the discovery ten years, and subsisted
chiefly on this herb, and on his death his disciples by his desire
planted it in an arbour about his tomb.</p>

<p>From this saintly sepulchre the knowledge of the effects of hemp is
stated to have spread into Khorasan. In Chaldea it was unknown until
728 <span class="allsmcap">M. E.</span> during the reign of the Khalif Mostansir Billah;
the kings of Ormus and Bahrein then introduced it into Chaldea, Syria,
Egypt, and Turkey.</p>

<p>In Khorasan, however, it seems that the date of the use of hemp is
considered to be far prior to Haider’s era. Biraslan, an Indian
pilgrim, the contemporary of Cosröes,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> is believed to have introduced
and diffused the custom through Khorasan and Yemen. In proof of the
great antiquity of the practice, certain passages in the works of
Hippocrates may be cited, in which some of its properties are clearly
described, but the difficulty of deciding whether the passages be
spurious or genuine, renders the fact of little value. Dioscorides
(lib. ij. cap. 169), describes hemp, but merely notices the emollient
properties of its seeds; its intoxicating effects must consequently be
regarded as unknown to the Greeks prior to his era, which is generally
agreed to be about the second century of the Christian epoch, and
somewhat subsequent to the life-time of Pliny.</p>

<p>In the narrative of Makrizi we also learn that oxymel and acids are the
most powerful antidotes to the effects of this narcotic; next to these,
emetics, cold bathing, and sleep; and we are further told that it
possesses diuretic, astringent, and especially aphrodisiac properties.
Ibn Beitar was the first to record its tendency to produce mental
derangement, and he even states that it occasionally proves fatal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>

<p>In 780 <span class="allsmcap">M. E.</span> very severe ordinances were passed in Egypt
against the practice; the Djoneina garden was rooted up, and all those
convicted of the use of the drug were subjected to the extraction of
their teeth; but in 799 the custom re-established itself with more
than original vigor. Makrizi draws an expressive picture of the evils
this vice then inflicted on its votaries—“As its consequence, general
corruption of sentiments and manners ensued, modesty disappeared, every
base and evil passion was openly indulged in, and nobility of external
form alone remained to these infatuated beings.”</p>


<h3><i>Medicinal Properties assigned to Hemp by the Ancient Arabian and
Persian Writers, and by Modern European Authors.</i></h3>

<p>In the preceding notice of Makrizi’s writings on this subject, we
have confined ourselves chiefly to historical details, excluding
descriptions of supposed medicinal effects. The Mukzun-ul-Udwieh and
the Persian MS. in our possession, inform us as to the properties which
the ancient physicians attributed to this powerful narcotic.</p>

<p>In <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> DaCosta’s MS. version of the chapter on hemp in the
Mukzun-ul-Udwieh, <i>churrus</i>, we are informed, if smoked through
a pipe, causes torpor and intoxication, and often proves fatal to the
smoker. Three kinds are noticed, the <i>garden</i>, <i>wild</i>, and
<i>mountain</i>, of which the last is deemed the strongest; the seeds
are called <i>sheadana</i> or <i>shaldaneh</i> in Persia. These are
said to be “a compound of opposite qualities, cold and dry in the third
degree—that is to say, stimulant and sedative, imparting at first a
gentle reviving heat, and then a considerable refrigerant effect.”</p>

<p>The contrary qualities of the plant, its stimulant and sedative
effects, are prominently dwelt on. “They at first exhilarate the
spirits, cause cheerfulness, give color to the complexion, bring on
intoxication, excite the imagination into the most rapturous ideas,
produce thirst, increase appetite, excite concupiscence. Afterwards the
sedative effects begin to preside, the spirits sink, the vision darkens
and weakens; and madness,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span> melancholy, fearfulness, dropsy, and such
like distempers, are the sequel—and the seminal secretions dry up.
These effects are increased by sweets, and combated by acids.”</p>

<p>The author of the Mukzun-ul-Udwieh further informs us—</p>

<p>“The leaves make a good snuff for deterging the brain; the juice of
the leaves applied to the head as a wash, removes dandriff and vermin;
drops of the juice thrown into the ear allay pain and destroy worms or
insects. It checks diarrhœa, is useful in gonorrhœa, restrains seminal
secretions, and is diuretic. The bark has a similar effect.”</p>

<p>“The powder is recommended as an external application to fresh wounds
and sores, and for causing granulations; a poultice of the boiled root
and leaves for discussing inflammations, and cure of erysipelas, and
for allaying neuralgic pains. The dried leaves, bruised and spread on
a castor oil leaf, cure hydrocele and swelled testes. The <i>dose</i>
internally is one <i>direm</i>, or forty-eight grains. The antidotes
are emetics, cow’s milk, hot water, and sorrel wine.”</p>

<p>Alluding to its popular uses, the author dwells on the eventual evil
consequences of the indulgence; weakness of the digestive organs first
ensues, followed by flatulency, indigestion, swelling of the limbs
and face, change of complexion, diminution of sexual vigor, loss of
teeth, heaviness, cowardice, depraved and wicked ideas; scepticism in
religious tenets, licentiousness, and ungodliness are also enumerated
in the catalogue of deplorable results.</p>

<p>The medicinal properties of hemp, in various forms, are the subject
of some interesting notes by Mirza Abdul Razes. “It produces a
ravenous appetite and constipation, arrests the secretions except
that of the liver, excites wild imagining, especially a sensation of
ascending, forgetfulness of all that happens during its use, and such
mental exultation, that <em>the beholders attribute it to supernatural
inspiration</em>.”</p>

<p>Mirza Abdul considers hemp to be a powerful exciter of the flow of
bile, and relates cases of its efficacy in restoring appetite—of
its utility as an external application as a poultice with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span> milk, in
relieving hæmorrhoids, and internally in gonorrhœa. A quarter of a
drachm of <i>bangh</i> is given in water as the dose in gonorrhœa. He
states, also, that the habitual smokers of <i>gunjah</i> generally die
of diseases of the lungs, dropsy, and anasarca, “so do the eaters of
<i>majoon</i> and smokers of <i>sidhee</i>, but at a later period. The
inexperienced on first taking it are often senseless for a day, some go
mad, others are known to die.”</p>

<p>In the 35th chapter of the 5th volume of “Rumphius’ Herbarium
Amboinense,” <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 208, Ed. Amsterd. <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1695, we find a long
and very good account of the hemp, illustrated by two excellent plates.
The subjoined is an epitome of Rumphius’ article:—</p>

<p>Rumphius first describes botanically the male and female hemp
plants, of which he gives two admirable drawings. He assigns the
upper provinces of India as its <em>habitat</em>, and states it to be
cultivated in Java and Amboyna. He then notices very briefly the
exciting effects ascribed to the leaf, and to mixtures thereof with
spices, camphor, and opium. He alludes doubtingly to its alleged
aphrodisiac powers, and states that the kind of mental excitement
it produces depends on the temperament of the consumer. He quotes a
passage from Galen, lib. i. (de aliment. facult.), in which it is
asserted that in that great writer’s time it was customary to give
hemp seed to the guests at banquets as a promoter of hilarity and
enjoyment. Rumphius adds, that the Mahomedáns in his neighbourhood
frequently sought for the male plant from his garden, to be given to
persons afflicted with virulent gonorrhœa and with asthma, or the
affection which is popularly called “stitches in the side.” He tells
us, moreover, that the powdered leaves check diarrhœa, are stomachic,
cure the malady named <i>pitao</i>, and moderate excessive secretion
of bile. He mentions the use of hemp smoke as an enema in strangulated
hernia, and of the leaves as an antidote to poisoning by orpiment.
Lastly, he notices in the two subsequent chapters varieties of hemp,
which he terms the <i>gunjah sativa</i> and <i>gunjah agrestis</i>.</p>

<p>In the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hortus Malabaricus</i>, Rheede’s article on the hemp is a
mere echo of Rumphius’ statements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>Among modern European writers the only information I could trace on
the <em>medicinal</em> use of hemp <em>in Europe</em>, is in the recent
work of Nees v. Esenbeck, from which the following is an extract kindly
supplied by <abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr> Wallich:—</p>

<p>“The fresh herb of the hemp has a very powerful and unpleasant
narcotic smell, and is used in the East in combination with opium in
the preparation of intoxicating potions, &amp;c. It is probable that the
<i>nepenthe</i> of the ancients was prepared from the leaves of this
plant. Many physicians, Hahnemann among them, prescribe the vinous
extract in various nervous disorders, where opium and hyoscyamus used
to be employed, being less heating and devoid of bitterness.”<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>No information as to the <em>medicinal</em> effects of hemp exists in the
standard works on materia medica, to which I have access. Soubeiran,
Feé, Merat and de Lens, in their admirable dictionary; Chevalier and
Richard, Roques (Phytographie Medicale); Ratier and Henry (Pharmacopeé
Française); and the Dictionnaire des Sciences Medicales, are all
equally silent on the subject.</p>

<p>In “Ainslie’s Materia Indica,” 2nd <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr>, we find three notices of this
plant and its preparations.</p>

<p>At page 39 “banghie” (<i>Tamul</i>), with the Persian and Hindee
synonymes of “beng” and “subjee,” is described as an intoxicating
liquor prepared with the leaves of the <i>gunjah</i> or hemp plant.</p>

<p>Under the head “<i>gunjah</i>,” Ainslie gives numerous synonymes, and
tells us that the leaves are sometimes prescribed in cases of diarrhœa;
and in conjunction with turmeric, onions, and warm gingilie oil, are
made into an unction for painful protruded piles. <abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr> Ainslie also
gives a brief view of the popular uses and botanical characters of the
plant.</p>

<p><i>Majoon</i>, lastly, is described by <abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr> Ainslie, page 176, as a
preparation of sugar, milk, ghee, poppy seeds, flowers of the datura,
powder of nux vomica, and sugar. The true <i>majoon</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span> however, as
prepared in Bengal, contains neither datura nor nux vomica. I have
already described the process by which it has been manufactured before
me.</p>

<p>In the “Journal de Pharmacie,” the most complete magazine in existence
on all pharmaceutical subjects, we find hemp noticed in several
volumes. In the “Bulletin de Pharmacie,” t. <span class="allsmcap">V.A.</span> 1810, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 400,
we find it briefly described by M. Rouyer, apothecary to Napoleon, and
member of the Egyptian scientific commission, in a paper on the popular
remedies of Egypt. With the leaves and tops, he tells us, collected
before ripening, the Egyptians prepare a conserve, which serves as the
base of the <i>berch</i>, the <i>diasmouk</i>, and the <i>bernaouy</i>.
Hemp leaves reduced to powder, and incorporated with honey or stirred
with water, constitute the <i>berch</i> of the poor classes. The same
work also (Bulletin, <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> i., <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 523, <span class="allsmcap">A.</span> 1809) contains a
very brief notice of the intoxicating preparations of hemp, read by M.
De Sacy before the Institute of France, in July, 1809. M. De Sacy’s
subsequent analysis of Makrizi, of which I have given an outline, is,
however, much more copious in details than the article in the Bulletin.</p>

<p>Professor Royle in his admirable work, entitled “Illustrations of the
Botany, &amp;c. of the Himalayas,” <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 334, gives a very brief notice of the
synonymes and epithets of the hemp resin, and mentions its intoxicating
properties, but affords us no information on its medicinal effects.</p>


<h3><i>Experiments by the Author—Inferences as to the Action of the Drug
on Animals and Man.</i></h3>

<p>Such was the amount of preliminary information before me, by which I
was guided in my subsequent attempts to gain more accurate knowledge
of the action, powers, and possible medicinal applications of this
remarkable agent.</p>

<p>There was sufficient to show that hemp possesses, in small doses, an
extraordinary power of stimulating the digestive organs, exciting the
cerebral system, of acting also on the generative apparatus. Larger
doses, again, were shown by the historical statements to induce
insensibility or to act as a powerful sedative.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span> The influence of the
drug in allaying pain was equally manifest in all the memoirs referred
to. As to the evil sequelæ so unanimously dwelt on by all writers,
these did not appear to me so numerous, so immediate, or so formidable,
as many which may be clearly traced to over-indulgence in other
powerful stimulants or narcotics—viz, alcohol, opium, or tobacco.</p>

<p>The dose in which the hemp preparations might be administered,
constituted, of course, one of the first objects of inquiry. Ibn Beitar
had mentioned a <i>direm</i>, or forty-eight grains of <i>churrus</i>;
but this dose seemed to me so enormous, that I deemed it expedient to
proceed with much smaller quantities. How fortunate was this caution,
the sequel will sufficiently denote.</p>

<p>An extensive series of experiments on animals was in the first place
undertaken, among which the following may be cited:—</p>

<p><i><abbr title="experiment">Expt.</abbr></i> 1.—Ten grains of Nipalese <i>churrus</i>, dissolved in
spirit were given to a middling sized dog. In half an hour he became
stupid and sleepy, dozing at intervals, starting up, wagging his tail
as if extremely contented; he ate some food greedily; on being called
to he staggered to and fro, and his face assumed a look of utter and
helpless drunkenness. These symptoms lasted about two hours, and then
gradually passed away; in six hours he was perfectly well and lively.</p>

<p><i><abbr title="experiment">Expt.</abbr></i> 2.—One drachm of <i>majoon</i> was given to a small
sized dog; he ate it with great delight, and in twenty minutes was
ridiculously drunk; in four hours his symptoms passed away, also
without harm.</p>

<p><i>Expts.</i> 3, 4, and 5.—Three kids had ten grains each of the
alcoholic extract of <i>gunjah</i>. In one no effect was produced; in
the second there was much heaviness, and some inability to move; in
the third a marked alteration of countenance was conspicuous, but no
further effect.</p>

<p><i><abbr title="experiment">Expt.</abbr></i> 6.—Twenty grains were given, dissolved in a little
spirit, to a dog of very small size. In a quarter of an hour he was
intoxicated; in half an hour he had great difficulty of movement; in
an hour he had lost all power over the hinder extremities, which were
rather stiff but flexible; sensibility did not seem<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span> to be impaired,
and the circulation was natural. He readily acknowledged calls by an
attempt to rise up. In four hours he was quite well.</p>

<p>In none of these or several other experiments was there the least
indication of pain, or any degree of convulsive movement observed.</p>

<p>It seems needless to dwell on the details of each experiment;
suffice it to say that they led to one remarkable result—that while
carnivorous animals and fish, dogs, cats, swine, vultures, crows, and
adjutants, invariably exhibited the intoxicating influence of the drug,
the graminivorous, such as the horse,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> deer, monkey, goat, sheep, and
cow, experienced but trivial effects from any dose we administered.</p>

<p>Encouraged by these results, no hesitation could be felt as to the
perfect safety of giving the resin of hemp an extensive trial in the
cases in which its apparent powers promised the greatest degree of
utility.</p>


<h3><i>Cases of Rheumatism treated by Hemp. Catalepsy produced by one
grain.</i></h3>

<p>The first cases selected were two of acute rheumatism and one of that
disease in the chronic form, occurring among the patients in the
Clinical Hospital of the Medical College. In the two former but little
relief had been derived from a fair trial of antiphlogistic measures,
and of Dover’s powder with antimonials; in the last case, sarsaparilla
at first, and subsequently the Hemidesmus Indicus with warm baths had
been tried without advantage.</p>

<p>On the 6th November, 1838, one grain of the resin of hemp was
administered in solution, at two, p.m., to each of these three patients.</p>

<p>At four, p.m., it was reported that one was becoming very talkative,
was singing songs, calling loudly for an extra supply<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span> of food, and
declaring himself in perfect health. The other two patients remained
unaffected.</p>

<p>At six, p.m., I received a report to the same effect, but stating that
the first patient was now falling asleep.</p>

<p>At eight, p.m., I was alarmed by an emergent note from Nobinchunder
Mitter, the clinical clerk on duty, desiring my immediate attendance
at the hospital, as the patient’s symptoms were very peculiar and
formidable. I went to the hospital without delay, and found him lying
on his cot quite insensible, but breathing with perfect regularity,
his pulse and skin natural, and the pupils freely contractile on the
approach of light.</p>

<p>Alarmed and pained beyond description at such a state of things, I
hurried to the other patients—found one asleep, the third awake,
intelligent, and free from any symptoms of intoxication or alarm.</p>

<p>Returning then to the first, an emetic was directed to be prepared,
and while waiting for it I chanced to lift up the patient’s arm. The
professional reader will judge of my astonishment, when I found that
it remained in the posture in which I placed it. It required but a
very brief examination of the limbs to find that the patient had by
the influence of this narcotic been thrown into that strange and most
extraordinary of all nervous conditions, into that state which so few
have seen, and the existence of which so many still discredit—the
genuine <em>catalepsy</em> of the nosologist.</p>

<p>It had been my good fortune years before to have witnessed two
unequivocal cases of this disorder. One occurred in the female clinical
ward in Edinburgh, under <abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr> Duncan’s treatment, and was reported by
myself for the “Lancet,” in 1828. The second took place in 1831, in a
family with whom I resided in London. This case was witnessed by <abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr>
Silver, <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> G. Mills, and several other professional friends. In both
these cases the cataleptic state was established in full perfection,
and in both the paroxysm terminated suddenly without any evil
consequence.</p>

<p>To return to our patient; we raised him to a sitting posture,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span> and
placed his arms and limbs in every imaginable attitude. A waxen figure
could not be more pliant or more stationary in each position, no matter
how contrary to the natural influence of gravity on the part.</p>

<p>To all impressions he was meanwhile almost insensible; he made no
sign of understanding questions; could not be aroused. A sinapism to
the epigastrium caused no sign of pain. The pharynx and its coadjutor
muscles acted freely in the deglutition of the stimulant remedies which
I thought it advisable to administer, although the manifest cataleptic
state had freed me altogether of the anxiety under which I before
labored.</p>

<p>The second patient had meanwhile been roused by the noise in the ward,
and seemed vastly amused at the strange aspect and the statue-like
attitudes in which the first patient had been placed, when on a
sudden he uttered a loud peal of laughter, and exclaimed that “four
spirits were springing with his bed into the air.” In vain we
attempted to pacify him; his laughter became momentarily more and more
incontrollable. We now observed that the limbs were rather rigid, and
in a few minutes more his arms or legs could be bent, and would remain
in any desired position. A strong stimulant drink was immediately
given, and a sinapism applied. Of the latter he made no complaint, but
his intoxication led him to such noisy exclamations that we had to
remove him to a separate room; here he soon became tranquil, his limbs
in less than an hour gained their natural condition, and in two hours
he represented himself to be perfectly well and excessively hungry.</p>

<p>The first patient continued cataleptic till one, a.m., when
consciousness and voluntary motion quickly returned, and by two, a.m.,
he was exactly in the same state as the second patient.</p>

<p>The third man experienced no effect whatever, and on further inquiry
it was found that he was habituated to the use of <i>gunjah</i> in the
pipe.</p>

<p>On the following day it gave me much pleasure to find that both the
individuals above mentioned were not only uninjured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span> by the narcotic,
but much relieved of their rheumatism; they were discharged quite cured
in three days after.</p>

<p>The fourth case of trial was an old muscular cooley, a rheumatic
malingerer, and to him half a grain of hemp resin was given in a little
spirit. The first day’s report will suffice for all:—In two hours the
old gentleman became talkative and musical, told several stories, and
sang songs to a circle of highly delighted auditors, ate the dinners
of two persons subscribed for him in the ward, sought also for other
luxuries we can scarcely venture to allude to—and finally fell soundly
asleep, and so continued till the following morning. On the noon-day
visit, he expressed himself free from headache or any other unpleasant
sequel, and begged hard for a repetition of the medicine, in which he
was indulged for a few days and then discharged.</p>

<p>In several cases of acute and chronic rheumatism admitted about this
time, half-grain doses of the resin were given, with closely analogous
effects; alleviation of pain in most, remarkable increase of appetite
in all, unequivocal aphrodisia, and great mental cheerfulness. In
no one case did these effects proceed to delirium, or was there any
tendency to quarrelling. The disposition developed was uniform in
all, and in none was headache or sickness of stomach a sequel of the
excitement.</p>


<h3><i>Case of Hydrophobia.</i></h3>

<p>A case now occurred in which the influence of a narcotic, capable
either of cheering or of inducing harmless insensibility, would be
fraught with blessings to the wretched patient.</p>

<p>On the 22nd November, at eight, a.m., a note in English was handed to
me by my servant, entreating my assistance for the Hakim Abdullah, then
at my gate, who had been bitten by a rabid dog three weeks before,
and who feared that the miserable consequences of the bite already
had commenced. I found the poor man in a carriage; he was perfectly
composed, though quite convinced of the desperate nature of his case.
He told me that the evening before, on passing near a tank, he started
in alarm, and since then was unable to swallow liquid.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span> His eye was
restless, suspicious, and wild; his features anxious; his pulse 125;
his skin bedewed with cold moisture; he stated nevertheless that he
wished for food and felt well. A small red and painful cicatrix existed
on the left fore-arm.</p>

<p>He was immediately removed to the hospital, where I accompanied
him. By his own desire water was brought in a metallic vessel,
which he grasped, and brought near his lips; never can I forget the
indescribable horrors of the paroxysm which ensued. It abated in
about three minutes, and morbid thirst still goading the unhappy
man, he besought his servant to apply a moistened cloth to his lips.
Intelligent and brave, he determinately awaited the contact of the
cloth, and for a few seconds, though in appalling agony, permitted some
drops to trickle on his tongue; but then ensued a second struggle,
which, with a due share of the callousness of my profession, I could
not stand by to contemplate.</p>

<p>Two grains of hemp resin in a soft pillular mass were ordered every
hour; after the third dose, he stated that he felt commencing
intoxication; he now chatted cheerfully on his case, and displayed
great intelligence and experience in the treatment of the very disease
with which he was visited. He talked calmly of drinking, but said it
was in vain to try—but he could suck an orange; this was brought to
him, and he succeeded in swallowing the juice without any difficulty.</p>

<p>The hemp was continued till the sixth dose, when he fell asleep and had
some hours’ rest. Early the ensuing morning, however, <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Siddons, my
assistant, was called up to him, and found him in a state of tumultuous
agony and excitement; tortured by thirst he attempted to drink; but I
will spare the reader the details of the horrors which ensued.</p>

<p>The hemp was again repeated; and again, by the third dose, the cheering
alleviation of the previous day was witnessed. He ate a piece of
sugar-cane, and again swallowed the juice; he partook freely of some
moistened rice, and permitted a purgative enema to be administered;
his pulse was nearly natural; the skin natural in every respect; his
countenance was happy. On<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span> <em>one</em> subject only was he incoherent,
and even here was manifested the powerful and peculiar influence of the
narcotic. He spoke in raptures of the ladies of his <i>zenana</i>, and
his anxiety to be with them. We ascertained, however, that he had no
such establishment.</p>

<p>Four days thus passed away, the doses of hemp being continued. When he
fell asleep, on waking the paroxysms returned, but were again almost
immediately assuaged as at first. Meanwhile, purgative enemata were
employed, and he partook freely of solid food, and once drank water
without the least suffering. But about three, p.m., of the fifth day he
sunk into a profound stupor, the breathing slightly stertorous; in this
state he continued, and without further struggle death terminated his
sufferings at four, a.m., on the 27th of November.</p>

<p>Reviewing the preceding summary of this interesting case, it seems
evident that at least one advantage was gained from the use of the
remedy—the awful malady was stripped of its horrors; if not less fatal
than before, it was reduced to less than the scale of suffering which
precedes death from most ordinary diseases. It must be remembered,
too, that in this, the first case ever so treated, I possessed no data
to guide me as to the dose or manner of administration of the drug.
The remarkable cases of tetanus detailed in the sequel throw light
on these important points, and will lead, in future cases, to the
unhesitating administration of much larger quantities than at first I
ventured to employ. I am not, however, rash enough to indulge the hope
which involuntarily forces itself upon me, that we will ever from this
narcotic derive an effectual remedy for even a solitary case of this
disease; but next to cure, the physician will perhaps esteem the means
which enable him “to strew the path to the tomb with flowers,” and to
divest of its <em>specific</em> terrors the most dreadful malady to which
mankind is exposed.</p>

<p>While the preceding case was under treatment, and exciting the utmost
interest in the school, several pupils commenced experiments on
themselves to ascertain the effects of the drug. In all, the state of
the pulse was noted before taking a dose,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span> and subsequently the effects
were observed by two pupils of much intelligence. The result of several
trials was, that in as small doses as a quarter of a grain the pulse
was increased in fulness and frequency; the surface of the body glowed;
the appetite became extraordinary; vivid ideas crowded the mind;
unusual loquacity occurred; and, with scarcely any exception, great
aphrodisia was experienced.</p>

<p>In one pupil, Dinonath Dhur, a retiring lad of excellent habits, ten
drops of the tincture, equal to a quarter of a grain of the resin,
induced in twenty minutes the most amusing effects I ever witnessed.
A shout of laughter ushered in the symptoms, and a transitory state
of cataleptic rigidity occurred for two or three minutes. Summoned
to witness the effects, we found him enacting the part of a Rajah
giving orders to his courtiers; he could recognise none of his fellow
students or acquaintances; all to his mind seemed as altered as his own
condition; he spoke of many years having passed since his student’s
days; described his teachers and friends with a piquancy which a
dramatist would envy; detailed the adventures of an imaginary series
of years, his travels, his attainment of wealth and power; he entered
on discussions on religious, scientific, and political topics, with
astonishing eloquence, and disclosed an extent of knowledge, reading,
and a ready apposite wit, which those who knew him best were altogether
unprepared for. For three hours and upwards he maintained the character
he at first assumed, and with a degree of ease and dignity perfectly
becoming his high situation. A scene more interesting it would be
difficult to imagine. It terminated nearly as suddenly as it commenced,
and no headache, sickness, or other unpleasant symptom followed the
innocent excess.</p>

<p>In the symptoms above described we are unavoidably led to trace a close
resemblance to the effects produced by the reputed inspiration of the
Delphic oracles; perhaps it would not be very erroneous to conclude
that it was referable to the same kind of excitement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span></p>


<h3><i>Use in Cholera.</i></h3>

<p>An epidemic cholera prevailing at this period, two of the students
administered the tincture of hemp in several cases of that disease,
and cures were daily reported by its alleged efficacy. <abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr> Goodeve was
thus led to try it in several cases, and his report was in the highest
degree favorable. The diarrhœa was in every instance checked, and the
stimulating effects of the drug clearly manifested. The durwan of the
college, an athletic Rajpoot, was attacked, and came under my treatment
after he had been ill seven hours; he was pulseless, cold, and in a
state of imminent danger, the characteristic evacuations streaming from
him without effort. Half a grain of the hemp resin was given, and in
twenty minutes the pulse returned, the skin became warm, the purging
ceased, and he fell asleep. In an hour he was cataleptic, and continued
so for several hours. In the morning he was perfectly well and at his
duty as usual.</p>

<p>It is but fair to state, however, that the character of the epidemic
was not at the time malignant. I admit the cases to be inconclusive,
but I conceive them to be promising, and that they deserve the due
attention of the practitioner.</p>

<p>Since this passage was written in 1838, the tincture of hemp has been
used in a great number of cases, both European and native, in the
hospital of the Medical College. I know no remedy equal to it as a
general and steady stimulant when given to <em>Europeans</em> in half
drachm doses during the tractable stage of this disease. I have known
the pulse and heat return and the purging checked by a single dose. It
allays vomiting much more certainly than the opium preparations, and
is not more likely than these to lead to cerebral congestion on the
cessation of cholera symptoms. The cheering effect on the patient’s
spirits is not the least benefit this remedy confers.</p>

<p>In <em>native</em> cases much less advantage was obtained; nearly all
this class of patients were old gunjah smokers.</p>


<h3><i>Use in Tetanus.</i></h3>

<p>I now proceed to notice a class of most important cases, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span> which the
results obtained are of the character which warrants me in regarding
the powers of the remedy as satisfactorily and incontrovertibly
established. I allude to its use in the treatment of traumatic
<i>tetanus</i>, or lock-jaw, next to hydrophobia, perhaps the most
intractable and agonising of the whole catalogue of human maladies.</p>

<p>The first case of this disease treated by hemp was that of Ramjan
Khan, aged thirty, admitted to the College Hospital, on the 13th of
December, 1838, for a sloughing ulcer on the back of the left hand.
Five days previously a native empiric had applied a red hot <i>gool</i>
(the mixture of charcoal and tobacco used in the hookah) to the back
of the left wrist, as a remedy for chronic dysentery and spleen. The
patient’s brother was similarly cauterised on the same day. In both
sloughing took place down to the tendons. Symptoms of tetanus occurred
on the 24th of December. The brother, who had refused to avail himself
of European aid, had been seized with tetanus at his own home four
days previously, and died after three days’ illness. On the 26th
December spasms set in, and recurred at intervals of a few minutes; the
muscles of the abdomen, neck, and jaws became firmly and permanently
contracted. Large doses of opium with calomel having been administered
for some hours, without the least alleviation of symptoms, and his
case having on consultation been pronounced completely hopeless, I
obtained <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Egerton’s permission to subject the poor man to the trial
of the hemp resin. Two grains were first given at half past two, p.m.,
dissolved in a little spirit. In half an hour the patient felt giddy;
at five, p.m., his eyes were closed, he felt sleepy, and expressed
himself much intoxicated.</p>

<p>He slept at intervals during the night, but on waking had convulsive
attacks.</p>

<p>On the 27th, two grains were given every third hour (a purgative enema
was also administered, which operated three times); the stiffness of
the muscles became much less towards evening, but the spasms returned
at intervals as before; pulse and skin natural.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<p>28. Improved; is lethargic but intelligent; spasms occasionally occur,
but at much longer intervals, and in less severity.</p>

<p>29. Dose of hemp increased to three grains every second hour. Symptoms
moderating.</p>

<p>30. Much intoxicated; continues to improve.</p>

<p>January 1, 1839. A hemp cataplasm applied to the ulcer, and internal
use of remedy continued. Towards evening was much improved; spasms
trivial; no permanent rigidity; had passed two <em>dysenteric stools</em>.</p>

<p>2. Morning report: Had passed a good night, and seems much better.
Evening report: Doing remarkably well.</p>

<p>3, 4, and 5. Continues to improve. Hemp resin in two grain doses every
fifth hour.</p>

<p>6. Five, p.m.—Feverish; skin hot; pulse quick; all tetanic symptoms
gone; passing mucous and bloody stools. Leeches to abdomen; a starch
and opium enema with three grains of acetate of lead every second hour;
tepid sponging to the body; hemp omitted.</p>

<p>7. Six, a.m.—Still feverish; stools frequent, mucous; abdomen tender
on pressure; no appetite; the ulcer sloughy, ragged, and offensive.
Opium and acetate of lead continued; abdomen leeched; sore dressed with
water. At noon there was slight rigidity of abdominal muscles. Hemp
resumed. At three, p.m., became intoxicated and hungry; ulcer extremely
dry, foul, and abominably fœtid; towards evening rigidity ceased. Hemp
discontinued.</p>

<p>From this day the tetanus may be considered to have ceased altogether,
but the dysenteric symptoms continued, despite of the use of opium
and acetate of lead; the ulcer, too, proved utterly intractable. Some
improvement in the dysenteric symptoms occurred from the 10th to the
15th, when natural stools were passed. He seemed gaining strength,
but the wound was in no wise improved; the slough, on the contrary,
threatened to spread, and two metacarpal bones lay loose in the centre
of the sore; on consultation it was agreed to amputate the arm, but to
this the patient peremptorily objected. The mortification<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span> now spread
rapidly, and, to our infinite regret, he died of exhaustion on the
night of the 23rd of January.</p>

<p>An unprejudiced review of the preceding details exhibits the sedative
powers of the remedy in the most favorable light; and, although the
patient died, it must be remembered that it was of a different disease,
over which it is not presumed that the hemp possesses the least power.</p>

<p>The <em>second</em> case was that of Chunoo Syce (treated by <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr>
O’Brien, at the Native Hospital), in whom tetanus supervened on the
11th of December, after an injury from the kick of a horse. After
an ineffectual trial of turpentine and castor oil in large doses,
two grain doses of hemp resin were given on the 16th of December. He
consumed in all 134 grains of the resin, and left the hospital cured on
the 28th of December.</p>

<p><i>Third case.</i>—Huroo, a female, aged twenty-five, admitted to
the Native Hospital on the 16th of December; had tetanus for the
three previous days, the sequel of a cut on the left elbow received a
fortnight before. Symptoms violent on admission. Turpentine and castor
oil given repeatedly without effect; on the 16th and 17th, three grains
of hemp resin were given at bed-time. On the morning of the 18th she
was found in a state of complete catalepsy, and remained so until
evening, when she became sensible, and a tetanic paroxysm recurred.
Hemp resumed, and continued in two grain doses every fourth hour. She
subsequently took a grain twice daily till the 8th of February, when
she left the hospital apparently quite well.</p>

<p><abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> O’Brien has since used the hemp resin in five cases, of which four
were admitted in a perfectly hopeless state. He employed the remedy in
<em>ten grain doses</em> dissolved in spirit. The effect he describes
as almost immediate relaxation of the muscles and interruption of the
convulsive tendency. Of <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> O’Brien’s seven cases four have recovered.</p>

<p>In the Police Hospital of Calcutta, the late <abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr> Bain has used the
remedy in three cases of traumatic tetanus, of these one has died and
two recovered.</p>

<p>A very remarkable case has recently occurred in the practice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span> of my
cousin, <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Richard O’Shaughnessy. The patient was a Jew, aged thirty,
attacked with tetanus during the progress of a sloughing sore of the
scrotum, the sequel of a neglected hydrocele. Three grain doses were
used every second hour with the effect of inducing intoxication and
suspending the symptoms. The patient has recovered perfectly, and now
enjoys excellent health.</p>

<p>Beside the preceding cases I have heard of two of puerperal trismus
treated in native females. Both terminated fatally, an event which
cannot discredit the remedy, when it is remembered that the Hindoo
native females of all ranks are placed, during and subsequent to their
confinement, in a cell, within which large logs of wood are kept
constantly ignited. The temperature of these dens I have found to
exceed 120° of Fahrenheit’s scale.</p>

<p>A curious coincidental proof of the value of hemp in these cases has
very recently come to my notice. In the appendix to Sir James Murray’s
“Medical Essays,” <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 16, dated Dublin 1837, occurs the following
passage:—“Having written the substance of these pages (Sir James’s
work) to my brother, then assistant-surgeon of the 60th Rifles, at the
Cape of Good Hope, he mentioned that a plant called <i>dyka</i>, or
wild hemp, which grows on the eastern coast of Africa, is used by the
natives for this purpose (the relief of puerperal convulsions), and
that they all, male and female, smoke it to bring on perfect relaxation
and relief from pain and spasm of any kind during its relaxing
influence.”</p>

<p>The preceding facts are offered to the professional reader with
unfeigned diffidence as to the inferences I feel disposed to derive
from their consideration. To me they seem unequivocally to show that
when given boldly and in large doses the resin of hemp is capable of
arresting effectually the progress of this formidable disease, and in a
large proportion of cases of effecting a perfect cure.</p>

<p>The facts are such at least as justify the hope that the virtues of
the drug may be widely and severely tested in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span> multitudes of these
appalling cases which present themselves in all Indian hospitals.</p>

<p>Messrs. Hughes and Templar, eminent veterinary surgeons of Calcutta,
have used the hemp resin in five cases of horses suffering from
tetanus; of these three have recovered. <abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr> Sawyers, of the medical
board, has cured a pony similarly affected.</p>

<p>Drs. Esdaile and Macrae have used the hemp with success; the former
in a case of tetanus; the latter in one of convulsions from neuralgia
of the testis, which had resisted every other remedy, and for which
the removal of the organ had been decided on. In the “London Medical
Gazette” <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Lewis gives a case of tetanus in which the hemp was used
with great relief to the symptoms, although it did not effect a cure.</p>


<h3><i>Case of Infantile Convulsions.</i></h3>

<p>A very interesting case of this disease has recently occurred in my
private practice, the particulars of which I have the permission of the
family to insert in this paper.</p>

<p>A female infant, forty days old, the child of <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> and Mrs. J. L., of
Calcutta, on the 10th of September had a slight attack of convulsions,
which recurred chiefly at night for about a fortnight, and for which
the usual purgatives—warm baths and a few doses of calomel and
chalk—were given without effect. On the 23rd the convulsive paroxysms
became very severe, and the bowels being but little deranged two
leeches were applied to the head. Leeches, purgatives, and opiates,
were alternately resorted to, and without the slightest benefit, up to
the 30th of September.</p>

<p>On that day the attacks were almost unceasing, and amounted to regular
tetanic paroxysms. The child had, moreover, completely lost appetite
and was emaciating rapidly.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>I had by this time exhausted all the usual methods of treatment, and
the child was apparently in a sinking state.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p>Under these circumstances I stated to the parents the results of the
experiments I had made with the hemp, and my conviction that it would
relieve their infant if relief could possibly be obtained.</p>

<p>They gladly consented to the trial, and a single drop of the spirituous
tincture, equal to the one-twentieth part of a grain of extract, was
placed on the child’s tongue at ten, p.m. No immediate effect was
perceptible, and in an hour and a half two drops more were given. The
infant fell asleep in a few minutes, and slept soundly till four, p.m.,
when she awoke, screamed for food, <em>took the breast freely</em>, and
fell asleep again. At nine, a.m., 1st of October, I found the child
fast asleep, but easily roused; the pulse, countenance, and skin
perfectly natural. In this drowsy state she continued for four days
totally free from convulsive symptoms in any form. During this time
the bowels were frequently spontaneously relieved, and the appetite
returned to the natural degree.</p>

<p>October 4. At one, a.m., convulsions returned and continued at
intervals during the day; five drop doses of the tincture were given
hourly. Up to midnight there were thirty fits, and forty-four drops of
the tincture of hemp were ineffectually given.</p>

<p>5. Paroxysms continued during the night. At eleven, a.m., it was found
that the tincture in use during the preceding days had been kept by the
servant in a small bottle with a paper stopper; that the spirit had
evaporated and the whole of the resin had settled on the sides of the
phial. The infant had in fact been taking drops of mere water during
the preceding day.</p>

<p>A new preparation was given in three drop doses during the 5th and
6th, and increased to eight drops with the effect of diminishing the
violence, though not of preventing the return of the paroxysm.</p>

<p>On the 7th I met <abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr> Nicholson in consultation, and despairing of a
cure from the hemp, it was agreed to intermit its use, to apply a
mustard poultice to the epigastrium, and to give a dose of castor oil
and turpentine. The child, however, rapidly became worse, and at two,
p.m., a tetanic spasm set in, which lasted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span> without intermission till
half-past six, p.m. A cold bath was tried without solution of the
spasm; the hemp was, therefore, again resorted to, and a dose of thirty
drops, equal to one and a half grains of the resin, given at once.</p>

<p>Immediately after this dose was given the limbs relaxed, the little
patient fell fast asleep, and so continued for thirteen hours. While
asleep, she was evidently under the peculiar influence of the drug.</p>

<p>On the 8th October, at four, a.m., there was a severe fit, and from
this hour to ten at night twenty-five fits occurred, and 130 drops of
the tincture were given in thirty drop doses. It was now manifestly a
struggle between the disease and the remedy; but at ten, p.m., she was
again narcotised, and from that hour no fit returned.</p>

<p>On the three following days there was considerable griping, and on
administering large doses of almond oil several small dark green lumps
of hemp resin were voided, which gave effectual relief. The child is
now (December 17) in the enjoyment of robust health, and has regained
her natural plump and happy appearance.</p>

<p>In reviewing this case several very remarkable circumstances present
themselves. At first we find three drops, or three-twentieths of a
grain, causing profound narcotism, subsequently we find 130 drops daily
required to produce the same effect. The severity of the symptoms
doubtless must be taken chiefly into account in endeavouring to explain
this circumstance. It was too soon for habit to gain ascendency over
the narcotic powers of the drug. Should the disease ever recur, it will
be a matter of much interest to notice the quantity of the tincture
requisite to afford relief. The reader will remember that this infant
was but sixty days old when 130 drops were given in one day, of the
same preparation of which ten drops had intoxicated the student
Dinonath Dhur, who took the drug for experiment.</p>


<h3><i>Use in Delirium Tremens.</i></h3>

<p>I have given the tincture of hemp an extensive trial in this disease,
and have had much reason to be gratified with its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span> effects. In
action it resembles opium and wine, but is much more certain than
these remedies. I have no hesitation in saying, that in the cases in
which the opium treatment is applicable, hemp will be found far more
effectual. The changed state of mind it produces is truly wonderful.
From the appalling terror which generally predominates, the patient
soon passes into a state of cheerfulness, often of boisterous mirth,
and soon sinks into a happy sleep. Of course there are many cases in
which this, or any other, narcotic should not be employed.</p>


<h3><i>Delirium occasioned by continued Hemp Inebriation.</i></h3>

<p>Before quitting this subject, it is desirable to notice the singular
form of delirium which the incautious use of the hemp preparations
often occasions, especially among young men who try it for the first
time. Several such cases have presented themselves to my notice. They
are as peculiar as the “delirium tremens” which succeeds the prolonged
abuse of spirituous liquors, but are quite distinct from any other
species of delirium with which I am acquainted.</p>

<p>This state is at once recognised by the strange balancing gait of the
patient, a constant rubbing of the hands, perpetual giggling, and a
propensity to caress and chafe the feet of all bystanders of whatever
rank. The eye wears an expression of cunning and merriment which
can scarcely be mistaken. In a few cases, the patients are violent;
in many, highly aphrodisiac; in all that I have seen, voraciously
hungry. There is no increased heat or frequency of circulation, or any
appearance of inflammation or congestion, and the skin and general
functions are in a natural state.</p>

<p>A blister to the nape of the neck, leeches to the temples, and
nauseating doses of tartar emetic with saline purgatives have rapidly
dispelled the symptoms in all the cases I have met with, and have
restored the patient to perfect health.</p>


<h3><i>Conclusion.</i></h3>

<p>The preceding cases constitute an abstract of my experience on this
subject, and constitute the grounds of my belief that in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span> hemp the
profession has gained an anti-convulsive remedy of the greatest value.
Entertaining this conviction, be it true or false, I deem it my duty
to publish it without any avoidable delay, in order that the most
extensive and the speediest trial may be given to the proposed remedy.
I repeat what I have already stated in a previous paper—that were
mere reputation my object, I would let years pass by, and hundreds of
cases accumulate before publication; and in publishing I would enter
into every kind of elaborate detail. But the object I have proposed
to myself in these inquiries is of a very different kind. To gather
together a few strong facts, to ascertain the limits which cannot be
passed without danger, and then pointing out these to the profession,
to leave them to prosecute and decide on the subject of discussion,
such seems to me the fittest mode of attempting to explore the
medicinal resources which an untried remedy may afford.</p>

<p>It may be useful to add a formula for making the preparations which I
have employed.</p>

<p>The <em>resinous extract</em> is prepared by boiling the rich, adhesive
tops of the dried <i>gunjah</i>, in spirit (sp. gr. 835), until all the
resin is dissolved. The tincture thus obtained is evaporated to dryness
by distillation, or in a vessel placed over a pot of boiling water. The
extract softens at a gentle heat, and can be made into pills without
any addition.</p>

<p>The <em>tincture</em> is prepared by dissolving the extract in spirit of
835° density.</p>

<p><i>Doses, &amp;c.</i>—In <i>tetanus</i> a drachm of the tincture every
half hour until the paroxysms cease, or catalepsy or narcotism is
induced. In <i>hydrophobia</i> I recommend the resin in soft pills, to
the extent of ten to twenty grains to be chewed by the patient, and
repeated according to the effect. In <i>cholera</i>, thirty drops of
the tincture every half hour will be often found to check the vomiting
and purging, and bring back warmth to the surface. My experience would
here lead me to prefer <em>small</em> doses of the remedy in order to
excite rather than narcotise the patient.</p>

<p>I have only further to add, that since the substance of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span> preceding
memoir was first published, numerous cases have come to my knowledge in
which the <i>churrus</i>, or resin prepared by the natives for smoking,
has been used with little effect. This was the case in some experiments
made by <abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr> Pereira with <i>churrus</i> which I sent him myself. Age
and adulteration have been probably both concerned in rendering this
substance inactive. But with the alcoholic extract made from the tops
in the way I recommend, the practitioner has only to feel his way, and
increase the dose till he produces intoxication as the test of the
remedy having taken effect.</p>

<p>Of all powerful narcotics it is the safest to use with boldness and
decision.</p>

<p>I have given <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Squire, of Oxford-street, a large supply of the
gunjah, and that gentleman has kindly promised me to place a sufficient
quantity of the extract at the disposal of any hospital physician or
surgeon who may desire to employ the remedy. My object is to have it
extensively and exactly tested without favor or prejudice, for the
experience of four years has established the conviction in my mind,
that we possess no remedy at all equal to this in anti-convulsive and
anti-neuralgic power.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="INDIAN_HEMP">INDIAN HEMP.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">TO THE EDITORS OF THE PROVINCIAL MEDICAL JOURNAL.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,—With reference to my paper on the Indian Hemp,
lately inserted in your Journal, I trust I may be permitted to disclaim
any wish to advance these preparations as specifics in the treatment
of tetanus, or in spasmodic diseases generally. That hemp possesses
great, indeed extraordinary, anti-convulsive power, I feel assured from
numerous facts which I have myself observed, and which others have also
witnessed. The cases of the six horses affected by traumatic tetanus,
recorded in my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span> paper, of which four recovered, are almost enough
by themselves to convince any unprejudiced person of the energy and
promise of this drug.</p>

<p>Many failures must be expected at first, from the salutary caution
all good practitioners must observe in the doses of a remedy with
which they are not practically familiar. On this point I have further
to remark that in a case of traumatic tetanus, now under treatment,
fifteen grain doses of the resin have been given every second or third
hour, and of these doses five taken before narcotism was induced.</p>

<p>In cases of tetanus, I consider no trial of the drug at all conclusive,
unless it has been pushed to the extent of inducing stupor and
insensibility.</p>

<p>Too much importance has been attached by commentators on my paper to
the occurrence of <em>catalepsy</em> as an effect of this drug; catalepsy
I have witnessed unequivocally in many cases, but the effect is not an
universal one; I have seen it produced by ten drops of the tincture,
and by one grain of the resin. But, on the other hand, I have given
fifty grains in one day to a tetanic patient without any such effect
being observable.</p>

<p>It seems quite evident, from the experiments made by <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Ley and <abbr title="doctor">Dr.</abbr>
Pereira, that much larger doses must be used in this country than
those we found sufficient in India. The cause of this is possibly
to be traced to molecular chemical changes taking place by age in
the constituents of the drug, and analogous to those familiar to the
profession in the case of hemlock and its active principle.</p>

<p>The tincture, made by dissolving the extract in spirit, I consider the
best form of the drug for use in tetanic cases—or the resin may be
made into an emulsion, by trituration with a little flour, carbonate
of soda, and mucilage. The soda tends to dissolve the resin, and its
use is in accordance with the precepts of the ancient Eastern writers,
who prescribed hemp with alkaline substances, and used acids in various
forms (such as oxymel and sorrel wine) to counteract its effects when
taken in overdoses.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I venture to refer to the very interesting cases<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span> lately
published by <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Ley, in the Provincial Medical Journal. Another memoir
from the same able pen, will, I understand, soon appear, and will
afford ample evidence of the therapeutic value of this agent. <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Ley
informs me that of the <em>anti-convulsive</em> power of the hemp he
entertains no doubt. This is the great, the valuable result to look
for; all else is comparatively of but little importance. On some minor
points <abbr title="mister">Mr.</abbr> Ley’s results differ from mine. This must be regarded but
as a proof of the accuracy of his observations—that he is recording
faithfully what he sees, and is not merely treading in the footsteps of
another.</p>

<p class="right">
<span style="margin-right: 6em;">I am, Gentlemen,</span><br />

<span class="smcap">W. B. O’Shaughnessy</span>, M.D.</p>
<p>
London, Feb. 8, 1843.<br />
</p>

<p>P.S.—I would take the liberty of inviting experimentalists to the
repetition on the hemp resin of the processes for preparing conia and
nicotina—namely by distillation with caustic potash or soda and water,
receiving the distilled liquid in dilute acid, and redistilling this
with an excess of alkali, as before. My departure from India interfered
with my trial of this process, and I think it likely to lead to
valuable results.</p>
